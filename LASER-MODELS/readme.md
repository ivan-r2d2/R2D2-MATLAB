# Code that implement the laser range finder likelihood models
In this section we have the code to get the results presented in
1. Calle, I. "An efficient MATLAB implementation of grid maps and laser range finder likelihood models for the autonomous navigation of mobile robots ", to appear.

All the implementation of the algorithms are inside de class "rfinder".

In the following figure we have the obtained likelihood model for the laser measurements described in the second figure.
